# Blog HW Part 1!



### What did we do in this assignment?

In this assignment, we designed a front-end for a blog.  Using a pre-written API, we were able to update (using a key) our specific blog section of the API.  In connecting with the API, our blog had the functionality to create a new post, delete a post, and edit a post.

### What did not work?
At this point, everything works!! yay!! :blush:
If I had more time, I would have worked on making the interface better, making better use of the page.  I am probably going to spend some more time on it once submitted before the next component of the assignment!

#### Special thanks:

A special thanks to Tim and Suman for meeting with me one-on-one today and yesterday to help me in ensuring my understanding.

Also, a shout-out to Divya Kalidindi for talking through a couple concepts with me!!
